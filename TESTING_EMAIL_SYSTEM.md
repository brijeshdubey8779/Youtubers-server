# Testing Your Email Notification System 📧

## ✅ **System Status: FIXED AND WORKING!**

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: The email templates directory was not configured in Django settings. This has been fixed and emails are now sending successfully with beautiful HTML templates!

Your Gmail app password is configured and working perfectly! Here's what you can test:

## 📧 **Email Configuration Active:**
- **Email**: brijeshdubey8451@gmail.com
- **App**: youtubers
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully sending emails with templates
- **Templates**: Beautiful HTML emails with your branding
- **Fix Applied**: Templates directory added to Django TEMPLATES setting

## 🛠️ **What Was Fixed:**

### **Problem**: 
- Django couldn't find email templates because the templates directory wasn't in the TEMPLATES setting
- API calls were successful but emails were failing silently due to template rendering errors

### **Solution**:
- Added `'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates']` to Django TEMPLATES setting in `tubers_api/settings.py`
- Now Django can find and render the beautiful email templates properly
